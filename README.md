This Counter project consists of **two different counters**, created to demonstrate **React state management** and **user interaction**.

There are two buttons on the screen: Toggle Counter and Toggle Names Counter. Clicking these buttons shows or hides the respective counter.
The Number Counter allows users to increase, decrease, and reset numeric values.
The Names Counter contains a list of names with Next and Prev buttons, allowing users to navigate forward and backward through the names.
This project is simple, interactive, and ideal for beginners.
